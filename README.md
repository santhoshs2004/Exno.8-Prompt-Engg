## Aim:  
To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for audio generation using AI models.

---

## Algorithm:

1. **Identify Audio Type**  
   Determine the category of audio to generate: music, ambient sounds, sound effects, or speech narration.

2. **Select an AI Model**  
   Choose a suitable AI model capable of generating audio based on text prompts. Some popular models include:
   - **MusicGen** (by Meta): For music generation
   - **AudioCraft** (by Meta): General audio generation
   - **Bark** (by Suno): For expressive voice narration
   - **Tortoise TTS**: For high-quality text-to-speech
   - **Riffusion**: For real-time music generation using spectrogram diffusion

3. **Design a Prompt**  
   Write a descriptive text prompt that includes:
   - Genre (e.g., jazz, lo-fi)
   - Mood (e.g., happy, mysterious)
   - Instruments or effects (e.g., piano, rain, vinyl crackle)
   - Voice features for speech (e.g., language, gender, accent, tone)

4. **Input the Prompt into the Model**  
   Use a user interface (e.g., Hugging Face, Google Colab) or API to submit the prompt to the chosen model.

5. **Generate Audio Output**  
   Let the model process the input and produce an audio file (typically in MP3 or WAV format).

6. **Evaluate the Output**  
   Listen to the audio and assess:
   - Audio quality
   - Relevance to prompt
   - Emotional tone or musicality
   - Clarity of speech (if narration)

7. **Refine the Prompt**  
   If needed, adjust prompt wording to better align output with expectations. Repeat generation and evaluation.

8. **Document the Process**  
   Save final prompts, generated audio files, and evaluation notes. Include comparisons between prompt versions if applicable.

## Solution:

### Step 1: Identify Audio Type  
Two types of audio were selected for this experiment:
- **Music Generation** (relaxing instrumental background)
- **Speech Narration** (text-to-speech with accent and tone)

---

### Step 2: Select an AI Model  

**Model 1: MusicGen (by Meta)**  
- Generates high-quality music based on natural language prompts.  
- Trained on a wide variety of music samples.  
- Supports control over tempo, instruments, and genre.  
- Available via Hugging Face and Colab notebooks.

**Model 2: Bark (by Suno AI)**  
- Multilingual, expressive speech synthesis model.  
- Supports voice modulation, emotion, tone, and prosody.  
- Generates text-to-speech from descriptive prompts, with control over accent and age.  
- Ideal for voiceovers, storytelling, and character narration.

### Step 3: Design a Prompt  

**Sample Prompts:**

#### 🎵 MusicGen Prompts:
1. `"Generate a slow lo-fi hip-hop beat with soft piano, ambient rain sounds, and vinyl crackle. Intended for focus and relaxation."`
2. `"Create an upbeat electronic track with synth melodies and rhythmic bass, similar to early Daft Punk."`

#### 🗣️ Bark Prompts:
1. `"Narrate the sentence 'Welcome to the AI audio world' in a calm, deep male British accent."`
2. `"Read the following in an excited female American voice with a storytelling tone: 'Once upon a time in a world of code and creativity…'"`

---

### Step 4: Input the Prompt  
- Accessed **MusicGen** and **Bark** via Hugging Face Spaces and Google Colab.
- Pasted each prompt into the input field.
- Ran the generation process with default sampling parameters.

---

### Step 5: Generate Audio Output  
- **MusicGen** produced a 30-second instrumental based on lo-fi and synth prompts.  
- **Bark** generated clear and expressive speech with noticeable accent and emotional tone.

---

### Step 6: Evaluate the Output  
**Music Output:**  
- Matched the mood (relaxing, slow tempo).  
- Vinyl crackle was present but ambient rain was too subtle.  

**Speech Output:**  
- British accent and tone were well executed.  
- Emotional storytelling tone worked well for longer narration.  

---

### Step 7: Refine the Prompt  
**Improved Music Prompt:**  
> `"Generate a 1-minute lo-fi hip-hop beat featuring layered piano chords, prominent vinyl crackle, background rain, and a slightly jazzy saxophone."`

**Improved Speech Prompt:**  
> `"Narrate with a warm, expressive male British voice: 'Welcome to your journey through the world of AI audio. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the future.'"`

---

### Step 8: Document the Process  
- Final prompts were saved in a prompt log.  
- Audio outputs were downloaded and archived for comparison.  
- Observations were recorded:
  - Prompt specificity greatly impacts quality.
  - More descriptive prompts lead to more accurate and refined outputs.
  - Bark is particularly strong for character voices and narrative delivery.

---

## Result:  
The audio generation process using prompting techniques was completed successfully. By iteratively refining the prompts and using suitable AI models (MusicGen and Bark), we were able to generate high-quality music and speech outputs. This exercise highlighted the power of prompt engineering in influencing AI-generated audio content.
